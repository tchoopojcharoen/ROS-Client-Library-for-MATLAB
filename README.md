# ROS Client Library for MATLAB (RCLM)
by Pi Thanacha Choopojcharoen

## Description:

RCLM is a wrapper library that converts the functionalities of basic MATLAB (such as *timer* and *event listener*) and MATLAB's ROS Toolbox into an OOP-styled frameworks.  

One neat addition to the library is All-in-MATLAB & All-in-Simulink turtlesim simulator along with an already written controller node both in MATLAB and Simulink.

The users are assumed to have some experience with ROS2 and MATLAB's ROS Toolbox. This repository has only been tested with MATLAB R2022a on Ubuntu 20.04.

Open the livescript "RCLM_instruction.mlx" for thorough documentation.

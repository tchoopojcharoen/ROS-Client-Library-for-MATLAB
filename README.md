## Description:

RCLM is a wrapper library that converts the functionalities of basic MATLAB (such as *timer* and *event listener*) and MATLAB's ROS Toolbox into an OOP-styled frameworks.  

One neat addition to the library is All-in-MATLAB & All-in-Simulink turtlesim simulator along with an already written controller node both in MATLAB and Simulink.
